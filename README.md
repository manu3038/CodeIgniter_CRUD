I have used form validation for adding the posts and also for the editting the same post using form validation library and I have also set custom form error message. I have only used codeIgniter provided functinalites for fetching the data from view to database and other wise. For the front end I have made use of HTML and Bootstrap. This app is connected to localhost database please change the credentials to your database for checking the funtionalities, this can de done in application/config/database.php. To view the application in local server intially run the local server then place the this app in WWW folder of localserver then go to localhost/DemoCI/index.php/welcome in the browser and your Crud application on codeigniter is working.
